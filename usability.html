                    <h3> Usability</h3>
                    <p> Usability denotes the ease with which end-users can employ a particular tool or other object in order to achieve a particular goal.
                        Usability can also refer to the methods of measuring usability and the study of the
                        principles behind an object's perceived efficiency or elegance. Jakob Nielsen,
                        a sometimes contraversial usability guru, writes in Usability 101:</p>

            <h4>Usability is defined by five quality components:</h4>
            <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Learnability:</b> How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?</li>
                        <li><b>Efficiency:</b> Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?</li>
                        <li><b>Memorability:</b> When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?</li>
                        <li><b>Errors:</b> How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?</li>
                        <li><b>Satisfaction:</b> How pleasant is it to use the design?</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Importance of Web Usability</h3>
            <h4>Establishing Credibility</h4>
            The content and design of your website should be engaging, accurate and fresh to establish credibility. Many factors play a role in establishing credibility, including the use of correct grammar and spelling, being truthful and not misleading customers. Also, the fonts you use will convey the tone of your small business's online presence. For example, financial institutions may rely on fonts such as Times New Roman and Arial, as opposed to the more-casual Comic Sans and Matisse.
            <h4>Building Trust</h4>
            Due to the level of risk involved in interacting over the Internet, trust greatly affects a website visitor's decision to engage in an online relationship with your small business. Aesthetics certainly play a part in shaping a first impression, but error messages and broken links matter too. Displaying sufficient contact information helps build trust, as the lack of a phone number or address may make potential customers leery to share personal information. In addition, poor branding and not fully disclosing privacy and security aspects of the online relationship can hinder trust.

            <h4>User-Centered Design</h4>
            Regardless of what artistic direction you take with your site, its design should keep the end user in mind. Ease of navigation is a major component of good Web design, and involves static links or menus that remain at the top of each page, also know as “above the fold.” Robert W. Proctor and Kim-Phuong L. Vu write in "Handbook of Human Factors in Web Design" that website visitors spend 80 percent of their scanning the top of each Web page. Font sizes should cater to the target audience; for instance, if your site primarily attracts seniors, a larger, 12-to-14-point font will make text easier to read.
            <h4>Customer Satisfaction</h4>
            The quality of the online relationship with your users and how well your website meets their needs has a direct influence on your bottom line. Web usability testing is often conducted to find out what users’ experiences are on a website, and the feedback garnered is used to implement improvements. You can find sample templates, questionnaires and more at Usability.gov to help you with designing, testing and maintaining a user-centered website (link in Resources).
